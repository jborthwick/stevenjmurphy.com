    </hgroup>

    <p>Steven James Murphy died November 22, 2023. Steven was born in Abilene, Texas, July 27, 1979 on Dyess Air Force Base to Kathy Garner Murphy of Dyer, Tennessee and James Murphy of Marcellus, New York. Steve and his sister were raised by their mother following their father’s death, and had the opportunity to call many states home.</p>

    <p>As an uncle, Steven was deeply loved. He engaged his sister’s kids with imagination and care, always knowing how to get a laugh or smile out of them and how to give them his full attention in the moments they were privileged to share.</p>

    <p>As a son, he loved profoundly. He cared for his mother through her lost battle with cancer: sharing jokes, providing favorite foods, and chauffeuring appointments.</p>

    <p>As a brother, he showed love in ways that were authentic to him. He stayed more closely connected to his sister than any other family, sending secret Christmas presents and grunting <em>“I love you”</em> each time they connected.</p>

    <p>Steven is survived by his sister Erin, brother-in-law Jeremy, niece Fiona, and nephews Malcolm and Rowan Borthwick of Boston, Massachusetts. He is also survived and remembered by his aunt, uncle and cousins of the Criswell family of Jackson, Tennessee and his aunts, uncles, and cousins of the Murphy family originating from Marcellus, New York.</p>

    <p>Steven’s ashes will be interred on June 25, 2024 in a small service and memorial attended by his closest family.</p>

    <p>In lieu of flowers, donations in Steven’s name to any charities do the work to lengthen and strengthen the lives of those who need support.</p>
